# Depth-study_Exe_RS
This is some exercises including Kmeans, KNN, Hierarchical clustering, Decision tree. The data is same as the RS final project. 
## K-means
### Image1: How to set the K value

### Image2: The silhouette performance

The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from âˆ’1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. 
In this case, the silhouette value is between 0.8 to 1.0, it proved that the K value is good enough.
